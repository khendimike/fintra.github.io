- I’ll be developing both the backend and frontend because I don’t have a project partner. I am also comfortable with both the languages.

### Technologies
Fintra can be built using a variety of technologies, including:
FrontEnd Technologies:
- HTML,CSS3, Javascript
- React framework, Bootstrap 5, Chart js
- BackEnd Technologies:
- Python, Flask
- MySQL database
- OAuth

### Challenge statement
Fintra will help solve a variety of problems related to managing personal finances, such as:
- Lack of visibility.
Many people have a hard time understanding where their money is going, and how much they are spending in different categories. Fintra will give users a clear and detailed view of their income and expenses, making it easier for them to make informed decisions about their spending.

- Difficulty sticking to a budget.
 Setting a budget can be difficult, and sticking to it can be even harder. A personal finance tracker can help users set budgets for different categories of expenses and track their spending against those budgets, making it easier to stay on track.

- Difficulty saving money
Saving money can be difficult, especially when there are many expenses to pay. A personal finance tracker can help users identify areas where they can cut back on spending and redirect those funds to their savings goals

### Unsolved problems
While Fintra can be a powerful tool for managing personal finances, it cannot solve all problems related to personal finances. Here are a few examples of problems that Fintra  may not be able to solve:

- Lack of self-discipline 
Fintra can help users set budgets and track their spending, but it cannot force users to stick to those budgets or make smart financial decisions. Ultimately, the success of a personal finance tracker depends on the user's ability to exercise self-discipline and make good financial choices.

- Lack of knowledge
Fintra can provide users with information about their income and expenses, but it cannot teach users how to use that information to make smart financial decisions. Users who lack basic knowledge of personal finance concepts such as budgeting, saving, and investing may find it difficult to fully utilize a personal finance tracker.

- Lack of income
Fintra can help users manage their money, but it cannot increase their income or solve financial problems caused by a lack of income.
Unexpected expenses
Fintra can help users plan for expected expenses and stay on budget, but it cannot predict or prevent unexpected expenses, such as major repairs or medical bills.

### Users
Fintra can be useful for a wide range of users who want to track their financial status.

### Risks
Fintra, like any other online platform, is not without risks. Here are the risks that may be  associated with using Fintra:
- Security risks
Fintra store sensitive financial data and personal information. If the platform is not properly secured, this data may be vulnerable to hacking or data breaches.

- Privacy risks
Fintra may collect and store a significant amount of personal information, including financial data, personal identification numbers, and other sensitive information. If this data is not properly protected, it may be used for malicious purposes.

- Data accuracy
Fintra relies on the accuracy of the data input by the user. Users must give accurate data.

- Risk of data loss
Fintra store data on servers, if the server goes down or is destroyed, the data is lost.

- Risk of Platform failure
Fintra is a software and it is subject to bugs and errors. If the platform is not maintained, it can fail.

- Risk of dependency
Fintra can give users a false sense of security, making them dependent on the platform. Users may stop paying attention to their finances and relying only on the platform's predictions, which can lead to problems in the future.

- Risk of addiction
Fintra can be addictive, especially when it comes to monitoring your spending and budgeting. Users may check their finances multiple times a day, which can be unproductive and can lead to stress.

- Risk of Not keeping the platform updated
Fintra are software, and they need to be updated regularly, if the platform is not updated, it can be vulnerable to security threats and errors.

## Infrastructure
### Deployment Strategies

#### Cloud deployment 
One of the most popular deployment strategies forFintra is to use a cloud-based platform, such as AWS or Azure. This allows for easy scaling and provides a high level of security and reliability.

#### Data Population
Several ways to populate a Fintra with data includes:
- Manual data entry
Users will manually enter their financial data, such as income and expenses, into the personal finance tracker. This can be a good option for users who want to have complete control over their data and only want to track a limited amount of information.

## Testing
### Unit testing
To test individual components of the application, such as functions or classes. This will be done using a framework such as unittest or pytest in Python.

### Functional testing
Test the application as a whole, by simulating user interactions and checking that the expected results are returned. This will be  done using tools such as Selenium or Cypress.

### Integration testing
To test the integration of the different components of the application and check that they work together correctly. This will be done by creating test cases that exercise the different parts of the application, such as the UI, the database, and the APIs.

### Performance testing
To ensure that it can handle the expected load and that it meets the performance requirements. This will be done using tools such as Apache JMeter or Gatling.

### Usability testing
By getting feedback from real users on how easy it is to use and understand. This will be done by allowing users to test the application and providing them with a set of tasks to complete.

### Security testing
To ensure that it is protected against common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other types of attacks. This will be done using tools such as OWASP ZAP or Nessus.

## Existing Solutions
There are many existing personal finance trackers available, both as standalone applications and as part of larger financial management platforms. Here are a few examples of popular personal finance trackers:

### Mint
A popular personal finance tracker that allows users to connect their bank and credit card accounts and automatically import transactions. Users can also create budgets, set financial goals, and track their net worth.

### Personal Capital
 A personal finance tracker that offers a wide range of features including investment tracking, retirement planning, and financial planning tools. Users can connect their bank and investment accounts to get a complete picture of their finances.

### PocketGuard
A personal finance tracker that allows users to track their income, expenses, and account balances, and provides insights into their spending habits. Users can also set budgets, and track their savings.
Both of these applications seem to be complicated to use. Fintra will be designed in a way that is easy to use.
